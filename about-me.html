        <h2>A few words about who I am</h2>
    <p class="mein-text">
        I am a frontend web developer who thrives when faced with new challenges and isn't afraid to step out of her comfort zone. I have a 
        passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that are easy to navigate. With my strong understanding 
        of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I am able to turn designs into functional websites with ease.</p>
    <p class="mein-text">
            But I am not stopping at mastering the basics. I am always looking for new technologies and frameworks to learn, and am not afraid 
        to take on a project that requires me to step out of my comfort zone. Whether it's working with a new programming language or 
        implementing a new design feature, I welcome the opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. </p>
    <p class="mein-text">In addition to my technical skills, I am also a great problem-solver. I have worked as a problem-solver asistent in Zalando 
        Logistics Moenchengladbach, where I sharpened this skill. I am able to think outside the box and come up with creative solutions 
        to complex issues. </p>
